moly.hu scraper to fill in metadatas for epub files

moly.hu is like goodreads but in Hungary, mainly for Hungarian readers.
I like reading a lot, have lots of ebook, but I get frustrated, when I have to fill the files with metadatas.

Since the moly.hu page has all the information on could need about a book, it is a perfect place to scrape from.

You have to add the file to repair, add the link of the book's moly-page, and give the new file's name.
